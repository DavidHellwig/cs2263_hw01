##Usage: 
Using powershell, or bash, type "gradle run --args="-command" to run a command.

-To use the -eval command, after entering the argument(gradle...--args="-eval"), type start and enter. 
If instead you wish to abort, type exit. Start and exit are not case sensitive and can be preceded or 
followed by an number of whitespaces. All numbers and operators must be followed by a single whitespace character
(single space). Hit enter when done.

-To use files for the command -b or --batch, create a txt file in the app directory with a given expression. 
 All numbers and operators must be followed by a single whitespace character
(single space).

-To use the output command, give a file name to which the program will output to. If no such file exists, one wil
 automatically be made. Then enter your expression.  All numbers and operators must be followed by a single 
 whitespace character (single space).
